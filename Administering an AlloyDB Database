# Task 1: Examine a Database Flag
Examine the Cluster Details:

UI Step: Navigate to AlloyDB > Clusters in the Google Cloud Console to view the cluster and instance details.
UI Step: Note the Private IP address of the lab-instance.
Set the Private IP Address as an Environment Variable:

Replace <ALLOYDB_ADDRESS> with the actual Private IP address you noted earlier.
bash
Copy code
export ALLOYDB=<ALLOYDB_ADDRESS>
echo $ALLOYDB > alloydbip.txt
Task 2: Setup a Database Extension
SSH into the alloydb-client VM Instance:

UI Step: In the Google Cloud Console, go to Compute Engine > VM Instances.
UI Step: Click on SSH next to the alloydb-client instance to open a terminal window.
Set the Environment Variable:

bash
Copy code
export ALLOYDB=<ALLOYDB_ADDRESS>
echo $ALLOYDB > alloydbip.txt
Launch the PostgreSQL (psql) Client:

bash
Copy code
psql -h $ALLOYDB -U postgres
Enable the pgaudit Extension:

Inside the psql prompt, run the following SQL commands:

sql
Copy code
\c postgres
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgaudit;
Verify the Extension:

sql
Copy code
SELECT extname, extversion FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pgaudit';
Exit the PostgreSQL Client:

bash
Copy code
\q
Close the SSH Terminal:

bash
Copy code
exit
Task 3: Create a Read Pool Instance for an Existing Cluster
Add a Read Pool Instance:

UI Step: In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to AlloyDB > Clusters.
UI Step: In the lab-cluster overview page, click on "Add Read Pool" or "Add Read Pool Instance."
UI Step: Set the Read pool instance ID to lab-instance-rp1, the Node count to 2, and select the machine type 2 vCPU, 16 GB.
UI Step: Click "Create Read Pool."
Note: Creating a read pool instance must be done through the Google Cloud Console UI.

Task 4: Setup Backups
Create an On-Demand Backup:

UI Step: In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to AlloyDB > Backups.
UI Step: Click on "Create backup."
UI Step: Ensure lab-cluster is selected as the source for the backup and enter lab-backup as the unique ID for the backup.
UI Step: Click "Create."
Note: Creating the backup must be done through the Google Cloud Console UI.

View Backup Details:

After creating the backup, you can view the details using Cloud Shell:

bash
Copy code
gcloud beta alloydb backups list
These steps combine both UI interactions and Cloud Shell commands to guide you through the tasks in your lab environment.
